### Hey 👋 I'm Bryan

I'm a software engineer and AR/VR enthusiast. I love gaming, futurism, sustainable gardening, and iced coffee. 

Oh, and boba ofc. 🧋

## 🤔 Current

I'm working on highly available distributed systems across multiple clouds, with an emphasis on speed and ease-of-use through FaaS-type systems. I'm passionate about building healthly + efficient engineering teams, while tackling scaling problems that affect the world.

## ⚡ Experience

Mostly backend engineering, with an eye for documentation, design, and polish. A lot of distributed systems knowledge. Self-taught in everything AR/VR -- ran the world's largest collegiate organization in VR. Worked for a unicorn, came back to big tech. Shipped a few video games and worked with a few research labs in robotics + AI.
