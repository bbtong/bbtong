Mostly backend engineering, with an eye for documentation, design, and polish. A lot of distributed systems knowledge. Self-taught in everything AR/VR -- ran the world's largest collegiate organization in VR. Worked for a unicorn, came back to big tech. Shipped a few video games and worked with a few research labs in robotics + AI.
